# Helios
Renamed from UIAPI.

Some hints:
* MUST be Framework 4.8 to maintain compatibility with IAPI.
* All projects that Helios depend on (Nova and Pipes) must be compiled in Framework 4.8.
* All projects that link Helios.dll MAY be Core (e.g. Core 8). This is being validated.
* Development platform applications, such as VirtualMS, can remain in Core. Helios can still connect to them.
